# mygcn
  
This repo contains my own implementation of a *very simple* graph convolutional network (gcn) using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [DGL](https://www.dgl.ai/) (DeepGraphLibrary).

The code is largely adapted from the [pygcn](https://github.com/tkipf/pygcn) implementation of Kipf and Welling and the helpful [DGL tutorials](https://docs.dgl.ai/tutorials/models/index.html). The background for the models is nicely explained in their [accompanying blog post](https://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/).
